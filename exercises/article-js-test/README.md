# Plain HTML, CSS, JS test

Purpose of this test is to evaluate the candidate's coding style and their eye for design. In alignment with the work of Editorial, the candidate's task is to visually enhance the basic article provided through the use of JS code and CSS styling and transitions.

## The task

The candidate is requested to:

- Restyle the article header using the first image provided, the article's title and the standfirst ('How better to celebrate 50 years of the stunning...')
- Animate the elements of the article header. This could be, for example, animating the title and standfirst in or creating a parallax effect.
- Split the body of the article in two columns. The left column will contain the text of the article without any media. The right column, will contain an image gallery with all the images present in the article.
- The images of the gallery in the second column animate in/out when the section of text they refer to is in the viewport
- Style the quotes provided in the text in an impactful way

Bonus:

- Make the layout responsive for these breakpoints:
  - 375px
  - 740px
  - 1140px
  - 1300px and above

NB.The candidate will have to change the layout strategically to show gallery and text on smaller viewports for which the two column layout is unsuitable

## Some additional requirements:

- The candidate must not change the html file directly. All the changes must be made by targeting the HTML elements either from within the JS file or through CSS selectors.

An example of our previous work that relates to the requirement of this test can be found [here](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ng-interactive/2023/jun/01/bruno-pereira-dom-phillips-amazon-indigenous-patrol-groups).
