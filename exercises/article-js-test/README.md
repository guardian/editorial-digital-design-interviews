# Plain HTML, CSS, JS test

The boilerplate for this test is available [here](https://github.com/guardian/editorial-digital-design-interviews/blob/main/exercises/article-js-test). Simply download the project folder named article-js-test. Follow the step-by-step instructions outlined in the README.md file to run the project.

Contained within the index.html file, you will find the structural markup for an article titled ‘Five of the Best Walks on England’s South West Coast Path’. Your task is to creatively consider how to effectively present this content to a mobile-first audience, making it engaging and captivating.

#Here are some guiding points to steer your approach:

- How can the positioning of the headline, primary image, and other elements capture the reader's immediate attention?
- What role does animation play in elevating the overall storytelling experience?
- In what ways can images be thoughtfully integrated to complement and augment the article's textual content?
- How can impactful quotes be utilised to provide context and relevance to the chosen topic?
- How can the article's layout be optimised to have a strong impact not only on desktop but across all breakpoints, especially mobile?

# Requirements

- Throughout the course of this test, kindly refrain from making direct edits to the index.html file. Instead, focus on leveraging CSS and JavaScript to target and manipulate the HTML. This mirrors the technical workflow often employed in Editorial contexts.
- We will give you a few days to complete this test, however we know you will have other commitments, so please do say how much time you've been able to spend on it and we'll bear that in mind when evaluating your work.
- Once the test is finalised, proceed to upload the entire folder onto a publicly accessible Git repository. Subsequently, share the repository's URL with us for evaluation.

# Newspaper Jargon

- Headline: a phrase that summarises the main point of the article. Headlines are large in size and in a different style in order to catch the attention of the reader.
- Standfirst: block of text that introduces the story, normally in a style different to the body text and headline.
- Byline: the line above the story, which gives the author’s name and sometimes their job and location.
- Pull quote: a quote from the story that is enlarged and appears within the text.
- Body text: written material, known as copy, that makes up the main body of an article rather than headlines, standfirst and captions.
- Furniture: everything on the page except pictures or text of stories
